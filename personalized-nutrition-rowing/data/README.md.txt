# Data Availability Notice

Please note that the primary dataset for this study, `JM.xlsx`, is not included in this repository. This is due to its use in the author's ongoing doctoral research and associated data-sharing restrictions.

To run the analysis notebooks successfully, you must provide your own data file that adheres to the following requirements:

1.  **File Name**: The file **must** be named exactly `JM.xlsx`.
2.  **File Location**: The file **must** be placed directly inside this `data/` directory.
3.  **File Structure**: The file **must** contain the 47 specific features (46 input features and 1 target variable) with the exact column headers used in the original study.

For a complete list of the required 47 column names, please refer to the "Data Availability" section in the main `README.md` file located at the root of this repository.

Once a correctly formatted `JM.xlsx` file is placed in this folder, the analysis notebooks should run as expected.
